filebeat:
  # List of prospectors to fetch data.
  prospectors:
    # Each - is a prospector. Below are the prospector specific configurations
    -
      # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
      # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
      # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
      # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
      # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
      
      paths:
        <% @paths.each do |path| %>

      # Configure the file encoding for reading files with international characters
      # following the W3C recommendation for HTML5 (http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding).
      # Some sample encodings:
      #   plain, utf-8, utf-16be-bom, utf-16be, utf-16le, big5, gb18030, gbk,
      #    hz-gb-2312, euc-kr, euc-jp, iso-2022-jp, shift-jis, ...
      #encoding: plain
      <% if @encoding %>encoding: <%= @encoding%><% end %> 

      # Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
      # The different types cannot be mixed in one prospector
      #
      # Possible options are:
      # * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
      # * stdin: Reads the standard in
      # input_type: log
      <% if @input_type %>input_type: <%= @input_type%><% end %> 
      

      # Optional additional fields. These field can be freely picked
      # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
      #fields:
      #  level: debug
      #  review: 1

      # Set to true to store the additional fields as top level fields instead
      # of under the "fields" sub-dictionary. In case of name conflicts with the
      # fields added by Filebeat itself, the custom fields overwrite the default
      # fields.

      # Scan frequency in seconds.

      # Setting tail_files to true means filebeat starts readding new files at the end
      # instead of the beginning. If this is used in combination with log rotation
      # this can mean that the first entries of a new file are skipped.
      #tail_files: false

      # Backoff values define how agressively filebeat crawls new files for updates
      # The default values can be used in most cases. Backoff defines how long it is waited
      # to check a file again after EOF is reached. Default is 1s which means the file
      # is checked every second if new lines were added. This leads to a near real time crawling.
      # Every time a new line appears, backoff is reset to the initial value.
      #backoff: 1s
      <% if @backoff %>backoff: <%= @backoff%><% end %> 

      
      # Max backoff defines what the maximum backoff time is. After having backed off multiple times
      # from checking the files, the waiting time will never exceed max_backoff idenependent of the
      # backoff factor. Having it set to 10s means in the worst case a new line can be added to a log
      # file after having backed off multiple times, it takes a maximum of 10s to read the new line
      #max_backoff: 10s
      <% if @max_backoff %>max_backoff: <%= @max_backoff%><% end %> 
      

      # The backoff factor defines how fast the algorithm backs off. The bigger the backoff factor,
      # the faster the max_backoff value is reached. If this value is set to 1, no backoff will happen.
      # The backoff value will be multiplied each time with the backoff_factor until max_backoff is reached
      #backoff_factor: 2
      <% if @backoff_factor %>backoff_factor: <%= @backoff_factor%><% end %> 

      # Defines the time on how long the harvester will wait for a line to be completed.
      # Sometimes a lines it not completely written when checked by filebeat. Filebeat
      # will wait for the time defined below so the system can complete the line.
      # In case the line is not completed in this time, the line will be skipped.

      # This option closes a file on windows, as soon as the file name changes.
      # This config option is windows only. Filebeat keeps the files it's reading open. This can cause
      # issues when the file is removed, as the file will not be fully removed until also filebeat closes
      # the reading. Filebeat closes the file handler after ignore_older. During this time no new file with the
      # same name can be created. Turning this feature on can on the other hand lead to loss of data
      # on rotate files as rotate files are not followed. We recommend to leave this option on false
      # but lower the ignore_older value to release files faster.
      #force_close_windows_files: false
      <% if @force_close_windows_files %>force_close_windows_files: <%= @force_close_windows_files%><% end %>
